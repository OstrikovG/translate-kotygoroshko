**_Kotygoroshko is a Ukrainian folk tale_**

There was one husband and he had six sons and one daughter. The sons went to the field to plow and ordered their sister to bring them dinner. She says:

\- And where will you plow? I do not know.

They say:

\- We will drag the skiff from the house all the way to the field where we will plow - then you follow that furrow and go.

Let's go.

And the snake, who lived behind that field, in the forest, took it and rolled it up, and dragged his own to his palaces. As soon as the sister carried the brothers to dinner, she followed that skiff and continued until she entered the snake yard.

There the snake caught her.

The sons came home in the evening and said to their mother:

\- They plowed all day, but you didn't send us to dinner.

\- Somehow she didn't send it? After all, Olenka suffered. I thought he would come back with you. Didn't get lost?

The brothers say:

\- We have to go look for her.

And all six of them followed that skiff and went to the snake yard where their sister was. They come there when she's there

\- My dear brothers, where will I put you, when the snake flies? - He will eat you!

When the snake flies.

"Ah," he says, "the human spirit smells!" What, guys, did you come to fight or to make peace?

\- No! - they say. - Fight!

\- Let's go to the iron stream! Let's go to the iron stream to fight.

They did not fight for long: as soon as the snake struck them, it drove them into that stream. He took them then barely alive and threw them into a deep dungeon.

And that man and woman are waiting and waiting for sons - none. Once a woman went to the river to wash, when a pea rolls along the road. The woman took the pea and ate it.

Later, she had a son.

They called him Kotygoroshko.

That son grows and grows, as if from water - not many years, but he has already grown big. Once a father and son were digging a well, they dug up a large stone. The father ran to call people to help throw the stone away. While my father was walking, Kotygo-roshko took it and threw it away. People come, as soon as they look - they are in a hurry. They were afraid that he had such power, and wanted to kill him. And he threw that stone up and picked it up, and the people ran away.

They dug further and found a large piece of iron. Kotygoroshko took it out and hid it.

That's why Kotygoroshko once asked his father and mother:

\- Should I have brothers and a sister somewhere?

\- Uh, - they say, - son, you had a sister and six brothers, and such and such happened to them.

"Well," he says, "I'll go look for them."

Father and mother persuade:

\- Don't go, son: six went, but died, and you are the only one so that you don't die!

\- No, I'll go anyway! How can you not liberate your blood?

He took the iron he had dug up and carried it to the blacksmith.

"Give me a mace, a big one!" he says.

When the blacksmith began to forge, he forged such a mace that it was difficult to carry it out of the forge. Kotyhoroshko took that mace, threw it up and said to his father:

"I'll go to bed, and you'll wake me up like a mace will fly in twelve days."

And lay down. On the thirteenth day, the mace is buzzing! His father woke him up, he jumped up, stuck his finger, the mace hit him and split in two. He says:

\- Well, you can't go looking for your brothers and sister with this mace - you have to tie up your friend.

Took her back to the blacksmith.

"On," he says, "make sure it's on me!"

The blacksmith forged an even bigger one. Kotygoroshko also threw that up and lay down again for twelve days. On the thirteenth day, that mace flies back, roars so that the earth trembles. Kotygoroshka was woken up, he jumped up, put his finger up, and the mace hit him. him - only slightly bent.

\- Well, with this mace you can look for brothers and sisters. Bake the loaves and dry the crackers, mom, I'll go.

He took that mace, loaves and crackers in his bag, said goodbye and left.

He followed that skiff, that ancient one that was still a little known, and went into the forest. Goes through the forest, goes and goes. When he comes to the big yard. He enters the yard, then the house, but there is no name, sister Olenka herself is at home.

\- You were healthy, girl!

\- I was fine, old man! But why did you come here: if a snake flies, then it will eat you!

\- So, maybe he won't eat it! And who are you?

\- I was the only daughter of my father and mother, but a snake stole me, and six brothers went to rescue me and died.

\- Where are they? - asks Kotygoroshko.

\- I threw the snake into the dungeon, and I don't know if it's still alive, or maybe it's rotted to ashes.

"So, maybe I'll free you," says Kotygoroshko.

\- Where do you want to be freed? Six didn't deliver, or you would have! - says Olenka.

\- In vain! — answers Kotygoroshko.

Yes, he sat on the window, waiting. When it flies a snake. He flew in and just arrived at the house - now:

"No," he says, "the human spirit smells!"

\- Wherever it was, - says Kotygoroshko, - when I arrived.

"Hey, boy, what do you need here?" Fight or reconcile?

"What's the point in putting up with it, fighting!" says Kotygoroshko.

\- Let's go to the iron stream!

\- Let's go!

They came The snake says:

\- Fight!

\- No, - says Kotygoroshko, - hit first!

The snake struck him on the bones and buried him in an iron shaft. He tore off Kotyhoroshko's legs, as he swung his mace, as he struck the snake, he drove him into an iron stream up to his knees. The snake broke out, struck Kotygoroshka - and buried him up to his knees. He struck Kotygoroshko a second time, drove the snake up to his waist into a stream, struck a third time, and killed him completely.

Then he went to the deep dungeons, unlocked his brothers, and they were barely alive.

Then he took them, took his sister Olenka and all the gold and silver that was in the snake, and went home.

So they go, but he does not admit to them that he is their brother. They crossed so many roads, sat down under an oak tree to rest. Kotygoroshko fainted after that fight and fell asleep. And those six brothers consult:

\- People will laugh at us that the six of us did not kill the snake, but he killed it himself. And he will take all the good of the snake for himself.

They consulted, consulted and consulted: now he is asleep, he will not hear, - tie him well with his face to the oak, so that he does not break free - then the beast will tear him apart. As they advised, they did so: they tied up and went away.

Kotygoroshko is asleep and does not hear that. Slept the day, slept the night, wakes up — tied up. As he jerked, he uprooted that oak tree. Then he took the oak on his shoulders and carried it home.

He approaches the house until he hears: the brothers have already arrived and are asking about the mother:

\- What, mother, did you still have children?

\- But how? Kotygoroshko's son was there and went to free you.

They then:

\- We tied him up, we have to run and untie him.

And when Kotygoroshko shoved that oak tree into the house, he didn't destroy the house enough.

\- Stay, when you are like this! - he says.

He goes and goes when he looks - there is a mountain and there is a mountain, and between them a man leans on those mountains with his hands and feet and pushes them apart. Kotygoroshko says:

\- Good morning!

\- Good health!

\- What are you doing, man?

\- I will push the mountains so that there is a way.

\- And where are you going? - asks Kotygoroshko.

\- Seeking happiness.

\- Well, I'll go there too. And how will you get along?

— Vernihora. And you?

— Kotygoroshko. Let's go together!

\- Let's go! They left.

They go when they see a man waving his hand in the middle of the forest, uprooting oak trees. Good afternoon!

\- Good health!

\- What are you doing, man?

— I twist the trees to make it more spacious.

\- And where are you going?

\- Seeking happiness.

\- Well, we're going there too. And how are you?

— Vernidub. And you?

— Kotygoroshko and Vernyhora. Let's go together!

\- I'm going.

The three of them went.

They are walking when they see a man with a huge mustache sitting over the river: as he twirled his mustache, the water parted so much that it was possible to walk on the bottom.

They are to him:

\- Good morning!

\- Good health!

"What are you doing here, man?"

\- But I divert the water to cross the river.

\- And where are you going?

\- Seeking happiness.

\- Well, we're going there too. And how are you?

— Crutivus. And you?

— Kotygoroshko, Vernyhora, Vernydub. Let's go together!

\- Let's go!

Went. And so it is good for them to go: where there is a mountain on the road, then Vernigora will overturn it, where the forest will turn Vernidub, where the river will divert the water, Krutivus. So they went into such a big forest, when they see - there is a house in the forest. They entered the house - there is no one. Kotygoroshko says:

\- This is where we spend the night.

They spent the night, and the next day Kotygoroshko said: - You, Vernygoro, stay at home and cook food, and the three of us will go hunting.

They left, and Vernigora cooked something to eat and went to bed. When someone knocks on the door:

\- Open it!

"Not a great master, you can open it yourself," says Vernyhora.

The door opened, and again someone shouted:

\- Transplant across the threshold!

\- Not a big man, you can climb over yourself.

When a small grandfather climbs in, and his beard drags on a fathom. How he grabbed Vernyhora by the forelock and pinned him to a whistle on the wall. And he himself ate and drank everything that was boiled and served.

Vernigora spun around, somehow broke free from the whistle, rushed to cook again; by the time the comrades arrived, he was already cooking.

\- Why are you late for lunch?

\- I dozed off a little. We ate and went to bed.

On the second day they get up, Kotygoroshko says:

\- Well, now you, Vernidub, stay, we'll go hunting.

They left, and Vernydub cooked food and went to rest. Until someone knocks on the door:

\- Open it!

\- Not a big man, you can open it yourself.

\- Transplant across the threshold!

\- Not a big man, you can climb over yourself.

When the old man climbs, he is small, and his beard drags for a fathom. How he grabbed Vernydub by the forehead and touched the whistle. And he himself ate and drank everything that was boiled and served.

Vernydub was struggling, struggling, somehow he had already lost his whistle and, well, hurry up and cook dinner. When it comes company.

\- Why are you late for lunch?

"I dozed off," he says, "a little...

And Vernihora is already silent: he guessed, it was true. Crutivus remained on the third day, and the same with him. And Kotygoroshko says:

\- Well, you are too lazy to cook dinner. You all go hunting tomorrow, and I'll stay at home.

The next day, the three go hunting, and Kotygoroshko stays at home. So he cooked food and went to rest. Someone knocks on the door:

\- Open it!

"Wait, I'll open it," says Kotygoroshko.

He opened the door, and there was a small old man, his beard trailing a fathom.

\- Transplant across the threshold!

Took Kotygoroshko, transplanted. When he kicks to him, kicks.

\- What do you want? - asks Kotygoroshko.

"But you'll see what," says the grandfather, he reached his forehead and just wanted to grab it, and Kotygoroshko:

\- That's what you are! - and so - grabbed his beard, grabbed an ax, dragged him into the forest, split an oak tree, put it in the split grandfather's beard and stuck it there.

"If you're like this," he says, "grandpa, you're going to get into trouble right now, then sit here, I'll come here again."

He comes to the house, and the company has already arrived.

\- What about lunch?

\- Long time ago. They had lunch, and then Kotygoroshko said:

— А ходіть лишень,— я вам таке диво покажу, що ну!

They come to that oak, when there is no old man, no oak: the old man of the oak uprooted and dragged the train with him. Then Kotygoroshko told his friends what had happened to him, and they already confessed about theirs, how their grandfather grabbed their forelock.

\- If he is like that, then let's go look for him.

And where the old man of that oak drags, - there you know what is dragged - they follow that path. And so they reached a deep pit, the bottom of which is not visible.

Kotygoroshko says:

\- Get in there, Wernigoro! Damn him!

— Well, you, Vernydub!

Vernidub didn't want to either, and Crutivus didn't want to either.

If so, - says Kotygoroshko, - I will lick it myself. Let's weave cords.

They wove cords, Kotyhoroshko wound the end on his hand and said:

"Get down!"

They began to descend, they descended for a long time, they still reached the bottom, all the way to another world. Kotygoroshko started to walk there, and he looked: there was a big palace. He entered that palace, when everything shines with gold and precious stones. He walks through the rooms, until the queen runs out to meet him, so beautiful, so beautiful that there is no better woman in the world.

"Oh," he says, "good man, why did you come here?"

"I," says Kotygoroshko, "are looking for a little grandfather with a fathom-long beard."

\- Well, - she says, - the grandfather is freeing the beard from the oak tree. Do not go to him, he will kill you, because he has already killed many people.

\- Will not kill! - says Kotygoroshko. - I also pinched his beard. Why do you live here?

\- And I, - he says, - the queen, but this grandfather stole me and is holding me captive.

\- Well, then I will free you. Take me to him!

She led. When really: the grandfather is sitting and has already freed his beard from the oak tree.

When Kotygoroshka saw it, he said:

\- Why did you come? Fight or reconcile?

"Why not," says Kotygoroshko, "to reconcile, to fight!" That's how they started to fight. They fought, they fought. And Kotygoroshko killed the old man with his mace.

Then he and the queen together took all the gold and precious stones in three sacks and went to the pit through which he descended. And he went and shouted:

\- Hey, brothers, are you still there?

\- IS!

He tied one bag to the rope and jerked it to pull:

\- This is yours.

Pull out, let the rope down again. He tied the second bag:

\- And this is yours.

And the third gave them everything he got. Then he tied the queen to the rope.

"And this is mine," he says. The three have pulled out the queen, then it's time to pull Kotygoroshka. They thought:

\- Why are we going to drag him? May the queen get to us better. Let's pull him up and then let go, he will fall and kill himself.

And Kotygoroshko guessed what they had already thought of, he took a stone and tied it to a rope and shouted:

\- Pull me!

They pulled it up high, and then threw it, the stone just gurgled!

\- Well, - says Kotygoroshko, - you are good too!

He went through the underworld. It comes and goes, when the clouds are pushed in, how will the rain and hail strike. He hid under an oak tree. When he hears, the griffins in the nest on the oak screech. He climbed an oak tree and covered them with his entourage. The rain has passed, a large vulture bird is flying in, the father of those griffins. The vulture saw that the children were covered and asked:

\- Who covered you?

And the children say:

\- If you don't eat it, we will tell.

"No," he says, "don't eat it."

\- There the man is sitting under the tree, then he covered it. The vulture flew to Kotygoroshka and said:

\- Say what you need - I will give you everything, because this is the first time that my children have remained alive, and that's all - I will fly away, and then there will be rain and hail - they will be in the nest and flooded.

"Take me away," says Kotygoroshko, "to the other world."

\- Well, you gave me a good riddle. It's no use, you have to fly. Let's take six kadovbs of meat and six kadovbs of water with us, then if I fly and turn my head to the right, then you will throw a piece of meat into my mouth, and if I turn to the left, then give me some water, otherwise I won't make it and fall

They took six kadovbs of meat and six kadovbs of water, Kotygoroshko sat on the vulture, and flew away. They fly and fly, when the vulture turns its head to the right, Kotygoroshko will throw a piece of meat into its mouth, and when it turns to the left, it will give it some water. They flew like this for a long time, and now they are already flying to this world...

Grif then returned home, and Kotygoroshko went to look for his friends. And they have already gone to the place where the queen's father is, there they live with him and quarrel among themselves: everyone wants to marry the queen, but they will not reconcile.

When it passes Kotygoroshko. They were frightened, and he says:

\- You betrayed me, I have to punish you! And I did.

And he himself married that queen and lives.
